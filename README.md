# fa2021-wildfire-smoke-paper

This repository contains the assets and code used to write my Fall 2021 Working Paper "Do Homeowners Care About Air Quality: Evidence from Wildfire Smoke" produced for ECON 191 at UC Berkeley, taught by David Card.  

I exploit the quasi-random distribution of air quality shocks induced by the increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires on the West Coast of the United to analyze the effect of air quality on housing prices.  

*Note:* I have omitted the "Raw Data" and "Clean Data" folders from this Repo because they are both over 1GB.
